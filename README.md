# Jupyter Notebook Setup Guide for Termux
## Introduction
Welcome to the guide on setting up Jupyter Notebook in Termux!
Jupyter Notebook is a powerful tool for interactive computing, data analysis, and data visualization.
This tutorial will walk you through the steps to install and configure Jupyter Notebook on your Termux environment.

## Prerequisites
Before we start, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your Termux:
- Termux app installed on your Android device (download it from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/))
- Stable internet connection

## Step 1: Update and Upgrade Termux
The first step is to update and upgrade your Termux packages to ensure you have the latest versions.
Open Termux and run the following commands:
```bash
apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
```
This command will update the package lists and upgrade any outdated packages on your Termux.

## Step 2: Install Python, Clang, Rust and Binutils
Next, you need to install Python 3, the Clang and Rust compiler, and Binutils.
These are essential components for running Jupyter Notebook.
Run the following command:
```bash
apt install python3 clang rust binutils -y
```

## Step 3: Upgrade pip and Install Required Packages
Now, let's upgrade the pip package installer to the latest version and install necessary packages for Jupyter Notebook. 
Run the following commands:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install wheel cython
```
These commands will upgrade pip to the latest version and install the Wheel and Cython packages.

## Step 4: Install ZeroMQ and PyZMQ
Jupyter Notebook uses ZeroMQ for asynchronous messaging. 
Let's install the ZeroMQ library and PyZMQ Python bindings by running the following commands:
```bash
apt install libzmq -y
pip install pyzmq
```
These commands will install ZeroMQ and PyZMQ on your Termux environment.

## Step 5: Install Jupyter Notebook
Finally, it's time to install Jupyter Notebook. Run the following command to install Jupyter using pip:
```bash
pip install jupyter
```

Once the installation is complete, you can launch Jupyter Notebook by running the command `jupyter notebook` in your Termux.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the installation process, here are some common troubleshooting steps:
1. **Update Termux**: Ensure Termux is up to date by running `apt update && apt upgrade`.
2. **Check Internet Connection**: Make sure you have a stable internet connection for package downloads.
3. **Review Error Messages**: Pay attention to any error messages displayed during the installation process.
4. **Search Forums**: Look for solutions on forums like Stack Overflow or Termux community forums.
5. **Reinstall Packages**: Sometimes, reinstalling packages can resolve issues. Try reinstalling the problematic packages.
